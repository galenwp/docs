# Orientation

When your urbit is finished booting you should see a `dojo>` prompt.

Let's stroll through what's already running:

### Shell â€” `:dojo`

The command prompt in front of you is a simple shell and Hoon REPL.
Let's make sure it works:

    ~fitund-macrep:dojo> (add 2 2)

Should produce:

    > (add 2 2)
    4

Good.
